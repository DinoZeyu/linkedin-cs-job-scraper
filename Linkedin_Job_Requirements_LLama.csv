We’re developing new tools and capabilities to amplify the human experience. To lead this transformative shift in mobility, we’ve built a world-class team in Automated Driving, Energy & Materials, Human-Centered AI, Human Interactive Driving, Large Behavior Models, and Robotics.

This is a Fall 2025/Winter 2026 paid 12-week internship opportunity in Los Altos, HQ. Please note that this internship will be an in-office hybrid role.

The Mission
Make general-purpose robots a reality.

The Challenge
We envision a future where robots assist with household chores and cooking, aid the elderly in maintaining their independence, and enable people to spend more time on the activities they enjoy most. To achieve this, robots need to be able to operate reliably in messy, unstructured environments. Our mission is to answer the question “What will it take to create truly general-purpose robots that can accomplish a wide variety of tasks in settings like human homes with minimal human supervision?”. We believe that the answer lies in using large-scale datasets of physical interaction from a variety of sources and building on the latest advances in machine learning to learn general purpose robot behaviors from this data.

The Team
Our goal is to revolutionize the field of robotic manipulation, enabling long-horizon dexterous behaviors to be efficiently taught, learned, and improved over time in diverse, real world environments.
Within this broader mission, the Pretraining team focuses on building foundation models that can effectively bridge visual, language, and robotic domains. We combine large-scale model training with empirical validation in simulation and on physical robots, emphasizing both fundamental research advances and practical capabilities. Our work spans computer vision, multi-modal learning, and robotic control, with particular focus on scaling up model architectures, training data (action-free and data containing robot actions), and training approaches that generalize effectively to physical manipulation tasks.

The Internship
As a Research Scientist Intern, you will conduct research in robot foundation model pretraining alongside our core technical team. You'll work on developing and implementing large-scale multi-modal models that bridge visual, language, and robotic domains and validate them on our simulated and physical robot fleet.

For this internship specifically, the project will focus on pre-training autoregressive Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, building on recent advances such as MolmoAct, with the goal of grounding multimodal reasoning in action spaces for robotics. In addition to large-scale autoregressive modeling, the work will involve co-training across multiple modalities -- including text, vision, depth, and action trajectories -- to enable richer representations and more robust cross-modal alignment. Explorations in this area will primarily focus on the data space (filtering web data, training on images and videos, etc.) while also leaving room for experimenting with novel architectural choices. The ideal candidate would preferably have some background in LLM/VLM training, as well as evaluating on robot simulation or real-world tasks.

Responsibilities
Advance the state of the art in training large-scale robot foundation models, and validate the impact of that research on real-world benchmarks and robots.
Work as part of a dynamic, closely-knit research team.
Implement high-performance machine-learning pipelines and optimize data and learning stacks for scalability, efficiency, and performance.
Present results in verbal and written communications at international conferences, internally, and via open-source contributions to the community.
Collaborate with internal research scientists, our engineering team, and our partner labs at top academic research universities including MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, CMU, Columbia, and Princeton to drive pioneering research at scale.

Qualifications
Currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Machine Learning, Robotics, or related fields.
Publications at high-impact conferences/journals (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, RSS, CoRL, CVPR, ACL, etc.) on some of the aforementioned topics.
Passionate about large scale challenges in ML grounded in physical systems, especially in the space of robotics.
Proficiency with one or more coding languages and systems, preferably Python, Unix, and a Deep Learning framework (e.g., PyTorch).
Ability to work in collaboration with other researchers and engineers to invent and develop interesting research ideas.
Experience training large-scale foundation models (LLMs, VLMs, diffusion models, etc) is desirable.
Familiarity with robots and the challenges inherent in conducting research on physical hardware platforms is desirable.


Please add a link to Google Scholar and include a full list of publications when submitting your CV to this position.

Under this system of protection, American industry has flourished. New products have been invented, new uses for old ones discovered, and employment opportunities created for millions of Americans. The strength and vitality of the U.S. economy depends directly on effective mechanisms that protect new ideas and investments in innovation and creativity. The continued demand for patents and trademarks underscores the ingenuity of American inventors and entrepreneurs. The USPTO is at the cutting edge of the Nation’s technological progress and achievement.

We relentlessly pursue (and share) the truth, bringing together millions of data points from quantitative and qualitative sources, enhanced by responsible, human-centered AI. Our purpose is to unlock potential across these communities, envisioning a world where doing the right thing is intuitive and informed.

At Seer, we see AI as a catalyst for innovation, collaboration, and creativity. Regardless of your division or discipline, leveraging AI is a core part of how we deliver smarter, faster, and more strategic outcomes for our clients. Our AI Council drives company-wide integration by focusing on education, purposeful implementation, and continuous learning — ensuring that AI is embedded in how we think, operate, and grow.

If you’re ready to uplift others, challenge your ego, commit to the truth, and be better than yesterday—keep reading.

Seer is a remote-first agency and a Certified B-Corp, with team members across the country. If an office environment is more your style, this position can also sit in our HQ office in Philadelphia. We can only consider candidates based in the US who can work continental US-based hours.

The Role:

Search is shifting fast—AI Overviews, LLM-powered experiences, and tools like SearchGPT are changing how people discover and decide. Seer is leaning in: building AI-assisted workflows, testing agents, and publishing early POVs on what AI means for marketers. You’ll help us experiment responsibly, measure impact, and ship useful things that make teammates and clients better.

Reporting to our Lead of Strategy and Generative AI, you’ll be collaborating with multiple stakeholders as we continue to responsibly integrate and scale AI across many organizational workflows.

Here are some highlights on what you'll be doing:
Experiment & Prototype:

Build scrappy proofs-of-concept that use LLMs to speed up SEO/paid/analytics workflows (e.g., classification, SERP analysis, ad creative iteration). 
Bring ideas from prompt to prototype, then to repeatable steps




Data & analysis:

Pair with Seer strategists to analyze how AI surfaces (AI Overviews/LLM citations) affect visibility and traffic; summarize findings for client-ready narratives
Run competitor / landscape analyses with Seer’s playbooks for AI-era search




Operationalize:

Turn working prototypes into mini-tools/playbooks (prompt libraries, evaluation checklists, SOPs)
Contribute to internal enablement (brown bags, quickstart docs, Loom demos)




Learn & contribute:

Join AI Council shares, readouts, and testing sprints; help keep our internal hub fresh with what’s working




Essential Mindset & Values:

Data-first, outcome-obsessed. You care less about “cool demos” and more about real business outcomes and clear measurement
Builder who ships. You’re comfortable iterating quickly, showing your work, and improving deployment consistency
Curious about search disruption. You follow AI changes (AI Overviews, LLM answers, SearchGPT) and can translate them into practical tests and recommendations
Cross-functional collaborator. You enjoy pairing with SEO, Paid Media, and Analytics to solve bigger problems with shared data
High integrity. You value responsible AI use, clear citations, and doing the right thing for clients and teammates




Essential Skills:

Prompt and context engineering in custom GPTs, Claude projects, and/or Gemini Gems
Comfortable with one or more: Python, SQL/BigQuery, Apps Script, or no-code/low-code automations (n8n/Make/Zapier)
Basic understanding of SEO or Paid Media concepts (SERP features, keywords/intents, ad variants)
Nice-to-have: experience with APIs (OpenAI, Google, Meta), embeddings/vector search, or lightweight front-end (Streamlit/Flask)
Communicates clearly—can write a crisp 1-pager and demo a prototype




Eligibility:

Pursuing a Bachelor’s in a relevant field (AI, CS, Data, Stats, Marketing, Info Systems, etc.) or equivalent self-taught/bootcamp portfolio
Part-time basis, :12-20 hours per week
Available to work from our Philly HQ 2 days a week, preferably Tues & Thurs

Chime was created because we believe everyone can unlock financial progress, and we want to develop solutions and services to empower people to succeed. The premise upon which we started Chime is simple: basic banking services should be helpful, transparent, and easy. Our easy-to-use tools and intuitive platforms give members the ability to have more control over their money and to take action toward achieving their financial ambitions.
By designing a member-centric banking app with easy-to-understand financial tools, we’re creating a more competitive market with options for everyday Americans. We offer access to accounts with no overdraft fees, provide members the chance to receive their pay up to 2 days early* with direct deposit, help them build credit history, and build financial literacy to hit their goals—among many other things.
Since 2012, we’ve grown our team to more than 1300 Chimers across 3 offices. But more than that, we’ve expanded the products and services we offer to our members based on member feedback. And in doing so, we’ve disrupted the banking industry and changed the conversation for everyday people about money on a national level.
Chime is a financial technology company, not a bank. Banking services are provided by The Bancorp Bank, N.A. or Stride Bank, N.A., Members FDIC.

Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.

About The Role

The Anthropic API has experienced rapid growth since launch, with companies of all sizes building AI products using our industry-leading models. We need an experienced Technical Program Manager to drive critical initiatives across our API organization as we continue to scale.

You'll be instrumental in orchestrating complex model launches, coordinating cross-functional features, and ensuring seamless execution across multiple teams. This role is critical as we expand our teams and scale our engineering organization to support frontier model capabilities, developer experience, and platform infrastructure.

Responsibilities

Lead model launch initiatives, including future Claude releases, coordinating between API, research, safety, and infrastructure teams to ensure successful deployments
Drive cross-functional program execution for major API features and platform enhancements, ensuring consistency and quality across all Anthropic surfaces
Partner with engineering leadership to improve development velocity, manage dependencies, and remove blockers across distributed teams
Build and maintain relationships with research, product, and engineering teams to understand technical requirements and constraints
Create comprehensive program documentation, including roadmaps, status reports, risk assessments, and communication plans
Facilitate technical decision-making by bringing together stakeholders, driving consensus, and ensuring timely resolution of blocking issues
Establish processes and frameworks for scaling API development and improving engineering excellence

You May Be a Good Fit If You

Have 5+ years of technical program management experience with a track record of successfully delivering complex, cross-functional programs
Possess deep technical expertise in APIs, distributed systems, or developer platforms with the ability to dive deep into technical details while maintaining strategic program oversight
Have experience in high-growth environments managing programs during rapid scaling phases
Are highly organized and can manage multiple parallel work-streams effectively across distributed teams
Thrive in unstructured environments with a knack for bringing order to chaos and creating clarity in ambiguous situations
Use a data-driven approach to technical program management with experience using metrics to measure success and guide decisions
Have a track record of building trust with technical teams and driving change through influence without formal authority
Are passionate about AI development and deployment, with a strong interest in AI safety and responsible development
Have experience with ML/AI products or model deployment pipelines (preferred but not required)

Annual Salary

The expected salary range for this position is:

$290,000 - $365,000 USD

Logistics

Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How We're Different

We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

Come work with us!

Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

In 1997, four advisors sharing an office space discovered they also shared an essential belief: The financial services industry needed a new and better way to provide advice to clients—one that would help relieve stress from their clients’ financial lives.
They built a firm that would deliver truly comprehensive financial guidance, all under one roof, so that clients wouldn’t have to deal with the hassle of managing multiple financial relationships, making complex decisions, or coordinating disparate accounts.
That idea has evolved into what we call the Roundtable™, our team of specialists and advisors in six core areas of wealth management. We believe that this team, paired with our 3-step UniFi™ process, helps ensure your financial life is organized, comprehensive and straightforward, enabling you to make more confident decisions and be less stressed when it comes to managing your wealth.

WHERE DO WE START?
How about Kansas City? That’s our home. That’s where Garmin put a stake in the ground in 1989. We’ve grown substantially over the years, offering diverse products and global reach in 5 diverse markets. But some things won’t ever change: Our entrepreneurial spirit and a culture where everyone’s opinion matters. That’s because we believe it’s possible to light the tech world on fire and still be on a first name basis.
BIG IDEAS, SMALL EGOS
What we do best is make products that let our customers do what they love. To do that, we focus on practical innovation, never losing sight of the benefits our products bring to our customers. Sure, we love bells and whistles. What leading technology company doesn't? But we make sure ours have purpose. It’s not about the things we make. It’s about the things we make possible.
WE’RE GLOBAL, SERIOUSLY.
Yeah, we’re based in Kansas City, but we are truly a global company. With offices throughout Europe, Asia, Middle East, South America and Australia, our products are sold all over the world. One elevator ride at our headquarters and you’re likely to hear 4 (or more) different languages being spoken. At Garmin, we may act local, but we think global.

Annual Salary

The expected salary range for this position is:

$255,000 - $320,000 USD

Logistics

Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's degree in a related field or equivalent experience.

Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.

Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.

How We're Different

We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.

The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.

As the nation’s leading health solutions company, we reach millions of Americans through our local presence, digital channels and more than 300,000 purpose-driven colleagues – caring for people where, when and how they choose in a way that is uniquely more connected, more convenient and more compassionate. And we do it all with heart, each and every day.

Title: Medical Scribe - Float

Company: Oak Street Health

Location: Various

Role Description

The purpose of a Clinical Informatics Specialist (CIS or Medical Scribe) at Oak Street Health is to support our primary care providers with clinical documentation so that they can focus on providing exceptional care to our patients. Scribes assist providers throughout the patient care journey - huddling each morning to plan for the day's visits, joining them in the exam room to observe and document, and touching base after the visit to assist with next steps.

Beyond the typical Scribe role, these important care team members serve as clinical documentation assistants to their paired provider. Internally, we call them CISs (Clinic Informatics Specialists) in recognition of their important role in supporting accurate, specific, and timely clinical documentation. In addition to observing and documenting all patient encounters in real time, our Scribes become experts in our value-based care model and the documentation and care of chronic conditions, including ICD-10 and CPT coding. Scribes use this expertise to help providers identify and help close care gaps. Scribes receive extensive on-the-job training in clinical workflows, value-based medicine, preventative care for chronic conditions, accurate and specific documentation, population health data streams, and team based care.

Because our patients and providers rely on our Scribes, the ideal candidate should commit at least 1-2 years to this role. This is an excellent opportunity for pre-med track individuals looking to gain practical, paid experience in a clinical setting before applying to an MD/DO/PA/NP program, as well as those pursuing careers in Health Informatics, Public Health, Healthcare Administration, Medical Coding, and other related fields.

SpaceX designs, manufactures and launches the world’s most advanced rockets and spacecraft. The company was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk to revolutionize space transportation, with the ultimate goal of making life multiplanetary.
SpaceX has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic milestones. It is the only private company ever to return a spacecraft from low-Earth orbit, which it first accomplished in December 2010. The company made history again in May 2012 when its Dragon spacecraft attached to the International Space Station, exchanged cargo payloads, and returned safely to Earth — a technically challenging feat previously accomplished only by governments. Since then Dragon has delivered cargo to and from the space station multiple times, providing regular cargo resupply missions for NASA.
